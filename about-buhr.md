It’s that family value that inspired Tim Buhr to open his own business over 20 years ago and is still demonstrated in every project – big or small – Buhr Construction tackles today.  
	
Growing up the son of skilled woodworker and handyman, Tim learned the basics from his father at an early age. He proceeded to gain well-rounded construction experience – with a strong focus on roofing – while employed with a local builder. Then, a minor setback unexpectedly presented a major opportunity for Tim… after being laid off from his job, he decided to open his own business in 1993. 

The growth of his crew and services were slow and steady, but his reputation for hard work, quality craftsmanship and friendly customer service grew quickly beyond his small Door County workshop. Over 20 years later, Buhr Construction has evolved from a one-man roofing business to full-service construction company including new construction, remodeling, tree removal, windows and siding, and an onsite sawmill and lumberyard, complete with a retail store to showcase their latest custom outdoor cedar furnishings. 

Still active in the business today, Tim leads his crews to be highly professional workers known for their quality craftsmanship and small-town, friendly approach to customer service. With roots and specialized talents for roofing and exteriors, Buhr Construction is also often hired as a valuable subcontractor, guaranteed to work respectfully and collaboratively as a partner to other area businesses.
