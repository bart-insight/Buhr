"We want to thank you for a wonderful job. It was a joy working with Buhr Construction. Your men were fantastic. They did a perfect job and left the yard spick and span. In the past weeks I have recommended Buhr Construction to four of my friends who needed roof work. The thought of having work done on the house no longer feels like an ordeal. I look forward to working with you again."
