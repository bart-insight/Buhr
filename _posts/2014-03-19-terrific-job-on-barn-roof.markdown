"The Buhr Construction team did a terrific job on our barn roof. The project was a roof replacement on a 150-year-old barn. The roof was very high and the tear off was a dirty job. They conscientiously looked for and repaired and/or replaced the deteriorated and rotted sections of the old roof before proceeding with the new roof."

"The team shared a strong work ethic and took pride in their work. The quality of their craftsmanship was outstanding, and even the cleanup was well done. Andy and Toby were good communicators during the project to ensure expectations were met or exceeded. I am very please with the new roof. Thanks again to the team for a job well done!""
