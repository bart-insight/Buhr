"We want to compliment you on your project coordinator Tom, and the crew that worked on our house. Tom was professional, timely and easy to work with. The crew that was sent to our house to install the roof and skylights were so hardworking and did an excellent job. Please pass on to all of them that we are very pleased. We highly recommend Buhr Construction."
