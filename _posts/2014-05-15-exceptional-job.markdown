"I want to compliment you and your crew for the exceptional job you did replacing the roof on our home. Corey and his crew were the most polite and professional group of young men I have had the pleasure of being around in a long time. I realize having the owners hang around can get a little taxing at times but they always answered my questions and explained things to us. Again, hats off to you and your men for an excellent job on our home."

-Mark and Mary Jo Seidl
