"We felt that all your employees did a great job in keeping the good reputation you have established. Tom was always good at answering our questions and keeping his appointments with us. He was friendly, made good suggestions and always returned our phone calls. 

We also felt lucky that Junior was the foreman for this project. He is a skilled worker who helped us to make decisions that improved the final look of our house. 

The remainder of the workers, Brian, Scott and others who helped, were also very hard workers. We appreciate their friendliness and good manners. They seemed to enjoy their work while doing it in a professional way. We would also like to thank you. We felt you treated us fairly and honestly throughout the project. Again, thanks for a great job!""
