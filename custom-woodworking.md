Buhr Construction has an on-site sawmill and lumberyard. That means the boards, framing and finishing materials we use for new construction and remodeling projects come from our very own workshop. This allows for total customization! From custom designed crown molding, trim cut to any length, or unique interior woodwork â€¦ if you can dream it, we can do it. 

Also, shop our ever-changing selection of custom outdoor cedar furnishings at our retail store! Choose from pre-stained or unstained options of beautiful handcrafted originals including gazebos, pergolas, arbors, tables, chairs, benches, gliders and more.
